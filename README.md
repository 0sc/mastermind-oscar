# Mastermind::Oscar
![coverage-badge](coverage/coverage.svg)
Mastermind_Oscar is a Ruby implementation of the classic board game of same name. The game is a code breaking game between two players; in this implementation, it is between a player and the computer.

The computer selects a random sequence of color characters whose length depends on the game level (beginner, intermediate and expert). The player tries to guess the sequence generated by the computer using the feedback from the computer at every attempt as a guide.
The game is over either when the player correctly guess the sequence or the player runs out of guesses; player has 12 guesses.
